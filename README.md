# studying-terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a product by [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) that uses [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (IaC) to provision cloud infrastructure. It uses [Hashicorp Configuration Language](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language) which provides a declarative syntax to develop infrastructure as code. The HCL configuration language helps declare the target state of cloud resources to be provisioned. This repository contains a collection of usefull modules, examples and resources used for learning about terraform and cloud providers, such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/).
